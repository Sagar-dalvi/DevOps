To install Jenkins on an EC2 instance, you can follow these step-by-step instructions.
These steps assume you have an AWS account and have already created an EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2.
If you're using a different Linux distribution, the commands might vary slightly.

Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance
Log in to your AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard and click on "Launch Instance".
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI): Select Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
Choose an Instance Type: Select an instance type (e.g., t2.micro) and click "Next: Configure Instance Details".
Configure Instance Details: You can leave the defaults and click "Next: Add Storage".
Add Storage: You can leave the defaults and click "Next: Add Tags".
Add Tags: Optionally, add tags and click "Next: Configure Security Group".
Configure Security Group: Create a new security group or select an existing one and add the following rules:
Type: HTTP, Port Range: 80, Source: Anywhere
Type: Custom TCP Rule, Port Range: 8080, Source: Anywhere
Type: SSH, Port Range: 22, Source: Your IP or Anywhere (recommended: your IP for security)
Review and Launch: Review your instance settings and click "Launch". Select an existing key pair or create a new one, then click "Launch Instances".
Step 2: Connect to Your EC2 Instance
Open your terminal (Mac/Linux) or use PuTTY (Windows).
Connect to your instance using SSH:
bash
Copy code
ssh -i /path/to/your-key-pair.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-instance-public-dns
Step 3: Install Jenkins
Update the package manager:

bash
Copy code
sudo yum update -y
Install Java (Jenkins requires Java):

bash
Copy code
sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
Add the Jenkins repository:

bash
Copy code
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
Install Jenkins:

bash
Copy code
sudo yum install jenkins -y
Start Jenkins:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start jenkins
Enable Jenkins to start at boot:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
Step 4: Configure Jenkins
Open your web browser and navigate to:

plaintext
Copy code
http://your-ec2-instance-public-dns:8080
Unlock Jenkins:

The initial administrative password is located in /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword.
Retrieve it using the command:
bash
Copy code
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Copy the password and paste it into the Jenkins web interface to unlock Jenkins.
Follow the Jenkins setup wizard:

Install suggested plugins.
Create your first admin user.
Configure the Jenkins URL (it will usually auto-detect).
Step 5: Access Jenkins
After the setup is complete, you can access Jenkins using the URL:
plaintext
Copy code
http://your-ec2-instance-public-dns:8080
You now have Jenkins installed on your EC2 instance and ready to use for your CI/CD needs.
